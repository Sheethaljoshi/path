# WayPoint Controller

This waypoint controller designed for optimal pathfinding and navigation. It was utilized in the **European Rover Challenge Championships 2024** in Poland, contributing to our achievement of **World Rank 18**.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path between waypoints.
- **Dynamic Path Adjustment**: Allows for rerouting based on new waypoints.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Optimizes the route to cover all waypoints efficiently.
- **Graph Visualization**: Displays the computed paths on map images.
- **CSV Integration**: Saves and loads paths and travel times from CSV files.

## Usage

1. **Upload Map Image**: Add your map and define waypoints.
2. **Calculate Path**: Use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest route.
3. **Solve TSP**: Find the optimal path for visiting all waypoints.
4. **Rerouting**: Modify the path and visualize new routes.
5. **CSV Export/Import**: Save your results for future use.


## Achievements

PathPlanner was a key tool in our strategy during the **ErC Championships 2024** in Poland, where we earned **World Rank 18**.
